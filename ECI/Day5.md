# Topic 1: Tracking with TrackMate II

For this tutorial we will be tracking the movies provided by Joanna in her session on 'Deep learning using BiaPy'.
In particular we will be using the model you trained in the 2nd session yesterday in a tracking pipeline.
There is nothing to download, if you have already the dataset from this session.


# Topic 2: Analyzing cell tracking results with CellTracksColab

Tracking cells is well and good but how to deal with the tracking results afterwards? How to visualize them? Compare conditions? This session introduces CellTracksColab to simplify the exploration and analysis of cell tracking data.

Contents:

- Short lecture to present CellTracksColab
- Practicals with the CellTracksColab platform

## Preparing for the practicals

Nothing to do! We will rely on Google Colab like BiaPy practicals did, and we will use the tracking results obtained with TrackMate during the previous session. Backup tracking results will be available in case you have any issue with the ones you generated.
