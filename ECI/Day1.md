[Fiji](https://fiji.sc/) is a popular and versatile image analysis software. This course will introduce basic concepts in bioimage analysis and how to apply them in Fiji. 

**Instructor**: Mélodie Ambroset, MicroPICell core facility, University of Nantes, melodie.ambroset@univ-nantes.fr

**Helper**: Héloïse Monnet, Collège de France

**Outline**
- Introduction to bioimage analysis, fundamental concepts
- Hands-on
  - Getting to know basic commands in Fiji
  - 2D segmentation workflow examples

**Preparation**
- **Fiji**: please download /!\ *a fresh version of* /!\ Fiji for your Operating System [here](http://fiji.sc/). Unzip it somewhere where you have full read/write permissions.
    - Note: If you have a previous version of Fiji and like it, you do not have to delete it, two Fiji can co-exist! But I would ask everyone to follow the course on a fresh version to prevent any issues. 
    - For Windows: "Caution: “Program Files” not recommended! On Windows, we strongly recommend that you store your Fiji.app directory somewhere in your user space (e.g., C:\Users\[your name]\Fiji.app) rather than in C:\Program Files or other system-wide directory. If you move Fiji.app to such a directory, modern versions of Windows will deny Fiji write permission to its own directory structure, preventing it from being able to update."
    - For Apple: it may be necessary to move the app to another folder when things are not working properly. "MacOS 10.12 (Sierra) and later have a security feature called Path Randomization that can cause ImageJ to not work as expected. Path randomization is in effect if the "ImageJ home" path shown in the Image>Show Info window starts with "/private" and plugins are not installed in the Plugins menu. You can disable path randomization by dragging ImageJ.app to another folder and then (optionally) dragging it back."

**Remark**: Image analysis with a trackpad can get quite uncomfortable, please bring your mouse!
