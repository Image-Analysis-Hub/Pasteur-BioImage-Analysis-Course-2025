# Topic 1: Icy for Bioimage Analysis

We will be using the alpha of the new version of Icy3, that we have been brewing in the past 2 years. 
This new version will be release after the course and will ship new means to interact with the Python scientific ecosystem. 
In this tutorial we will learn and discover how to use Icy for Bioimage Analysis, using the alpha version.

## Preparing for the tutorial

### Java

Like Fiji and QuPath, Icy is a Java software, so we need to dowload Java. 
And for the new and future version of these software, we will be using Java version 21.
If you want to know what version of Java you have, open a terminal and type

```sh
java -version
```

If you see something like
```
java version "21.x.y" 2025-04-15 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 21.0.7+8-LTS-245)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.7+8-LTS-245, mixed mode, sharing)
```
you are good.

Otherwise, download and install Java 21 from there:

Ask the helpers if you have doubt about what version to install.

### Installing Icy

You can dowload the alpha of Icy from here:

The double-click the app. 
If Java was properly installed, you should see a window like this one:

In the first run, Icy will copy libraries to an adequate folder in your home directory.
