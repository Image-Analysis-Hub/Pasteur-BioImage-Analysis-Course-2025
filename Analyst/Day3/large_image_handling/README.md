# Scaling BioImage Analysis with OME-Zarr and Dask

This workshop introduces the OME-Zarr format for storing large multi-dimensional images and how to use Dask to process these in Python. It assumes familiarity with Python and Jupyter notebooks, as well as basic knowledge of bioimage analysis concepts.

## Practical setup

### Conda environment

Create a conda environment with the packages required for this workshop. This can be done by running the following command in your terminal (after navigating to the `large_image_handling` directory):

```bash
`conda env create -f environment.yml`
```

### Jupyter Notebook

To run the Jupyter notebooks, you can use the following command in your terminal to start the Jupyter server:

```bash
jupyterlab
```
