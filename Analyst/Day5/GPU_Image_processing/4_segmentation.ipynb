    "# 3D Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Image segmentation in 3D is challenging for several reasons: In many microscopy imaging techniques, image quality varies in space: For example intensity and/or contrast degrades the deeper you image inside a sample. Furthermore, touching nuclei are hard to differentiate in an automated way. Last but not least, anisotropy is difficult to handle depending on the applied algorithms and respective given parameters. Some algorithms, like the [Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/voronoi_otsu_labeling.ipynb) approach demonstrated here, only work for isotropic data.\n",
